I know you're going through tough shit
And you need someone to listen to you talk about how your day went
But I won't know what to say next
I start thinking in cycles, in cycles
And driving in circles, in circles
And missing the same turn four times

So I drove back to your mom's house
All cold and unresponsive
All discombobulated
And I know how much you hate it
I guess I was your source of the sense of support
That I desperately need but I'm too scared to ask for
It's hard to provide a good shoulder to cry on
For someone you don't trust enough in yourself to rely on

We are:
Bean bums, Joyce shows, trips to the ER
Swear I remember
This is how friends work
I understand something now:

I wanna be someone that you can be yourself around
