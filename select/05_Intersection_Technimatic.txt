Intersection
Happened years ago
From the headaches
From the cold
From the endings of the words you knew
To the lungs that learned to breathe

Forfeit the lessons
Anyway, let's go
Don't paint the numbers
Protect against the fading
Shades to gray
Back from tomorrow to today

Seven leaves
From seven trees
Is seventeen
Only seven days

Don't paint the numbers
Don't face the mirror
Catch the cold
For today has only
For tomorrow never comes

Forfeit the lessons
Intersection
Forfeit the lessons
Intersection
Forfeit the lessons
Intersection

Intersection
